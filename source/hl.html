                    Valve’s debut title was the game ‘Half-Life’ released in 1998. It was a story based action horror
                    first-person shooter, where the player assumed the role of the scientist Gordon Freeman who must
                    escape the ‘Black Mesa Research Facility’ after a science experiment gone wrong causes it to be
                    invaded by extra-terrestrial beings.

                    The game was a smash hit and was praised for its realistic graphics and gameplay.

                    Half-Life took a different approach from other games as to how it told its story that made it stand out from the crowd. One
                    major thing it did differently to contemporary first person shooters at the time was that all of its
                    narrative was conveyed through scripted events that the player experienced themselves while playing,
                    as opposed to conveying the story through animated cutscenes which most games were doing at the
                    time. This meant control was never taken away from the player, allowing them to become more immersed
                    in the game’s world.

                Now, scripted events in games are the norm and this is thanks to valve’s innovative approach to
                making games.

                Half-Life took a on new life after release, with many fans interested in modifying the game to
                create new experiences. This was encouraged by Valve, who released a "software development kit" giving more tools to
                fans and developers to create the mods they wanted.

                Some of the most popular mods took on a life of their own, with ‘Counter Strike’ and ‘Team Fortress’
                being popular examples. These were fanmade mods that were acquired by Valve and released as their own separate games later on, these examples even spawing their own sequals with ‘Team Fortress 2’ and ‘Counter Strike: Global Offensive’ being games that are played by millions
                of players today.
